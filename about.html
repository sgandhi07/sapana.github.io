    <h5 class="my-5" class="glow" style="font-size: 14px; color: green;">I want to study Landscape Architecture at Rutgers to ground my experiential understanding of landscape operations and management with a firm, design foundation. I studied politics as an undergraduate, where I developed a keen interest in urban and regional land use and community-oriented praxis. After graduating, I took on various roles that allowed me to explore and engage with these themes. I worked with an urban farm, urban green roof, city planning department, and other organizations that allowed me to develop complementary perspectives on urban land use, planning, design, and operations. Studying landscape architecture at Rutgers will give me a platform to coalesce my experiences, skills, and interests towards my professional goal of planning and designing ecological, restorative, and resilient landscapes.
      <br><br>
      The climate crisis solidifies my draw to this study because carbon sequestering, stormwater management, and developing coastal resiliency play critical roles in our ability to mitigate the worst effects of a warming planet. I am determined to situate myself in a position where I can contribute to the well-being of our land and water ecosystems. I understand the interlinked, interdependent, and interdisciplinary nature of the issues we are facing, and I want to study Landscape Architecture to gain the skills and knowledge to not only affect and shape our built environment but also contribute to its scientific study and design.
      <br><br>
      I grew up in suburbia with minimal interaction with the natural world. I possess no inherited knowledge nor relationship with the land, but I rectified this deficiency by becoming an urban farm educator apprentice at The Battery Conservancy. This experience crystallized my drive to continue working with outdoor green spaces; and I gained hands-on knowledge on the basics of no-till farming, plant care and management, and working with the seasons. I discovered I thrive in outdoor settings, and one of many reasons I want to study landscape architecture is the opportunity to better integrate the outdoor and indoor processes.
      <br><br>
      Along with outdoor-oriented work, I am proficient in data management and visualization, and I want to build upon these skills towards a practice of landscape architecture, especially as it pertains to plant design, ecosystem functions and services, hydrology, and green infrastructure. As Operations Data Coordinator at Friends of the High Line, I worked with the Green Roof Research Alliance to designate the High Line park as a green roof, which now enables to pursue research and collaborative partnerships with schools, universities, and the City, as well as grant and funding opportunities. I am drawn to research, science, and data, and I want to study landscape architecture at Rutgers due to its scientific and design focus. Interaction between the natural world and technology can be highly iterative and enlightening, and I am looking to build analytic and reporting capacity within this domain. The High Line is split into different ecosystems, and I worked with the gardeners to identify key species in each zone and ways to track their behavior. This experience opened the world of ecosystem design for me, and I am eager to learn about plant design at Rutgers.
      <br><br>
      This year I completed the Green Infrastructure Champions program at Rutgers Cooperative Extension Water Resources Program and further learned how plants and growing mediums can provide ecosystem services such as stormwater management. This opportunity led me to look into the Rutgers Master of Landscape Architecture program because I am also looking to engage with the wider environmental community to advocate for sound policy and practices. I am currently finding ways to plug in with the Municipal Engagement Subcommittee within the Jersey Water Works Green Infrastructure Committee, where I hope to support the work regarding maintenance and metrics of rain water gardens. Studying at Rutgers would allow me the capacity and resources to fully delve into the study and practice of my interests which come together under landscape architecture.</h5>
